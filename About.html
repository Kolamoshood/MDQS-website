                        It makes no difference in reason or law into what other form different from the original the change may have been madeâ€¦ for the product or of substitute for the original thing still follows the nature of the thing itself, as long as it can be ascertained to be such, and the right only ceases when the means of ascertainment fail, which is the case when the subject is turned into money, and mixed and confounded in a general mass of the same description.

                        The relation of Common Law to Equity with regard to tracing of property is not merely a theoretical subject of discourse. Its significance has surfaced in different literature reviews. The remedies available for tracing property are, unfortunately, affected by the continued significance of the different rules applicable and available under Common Law and Equity.

                        Tracing is a legal process, not a remedy, by which a claimant demonstrates what has happened to his property, identifies its proceeds and those persons who have handled or received them, and ask the court to award proprietary claim against the property, or an asset substituted for the original property or its proceeds. Tracing allows transmission of legal claims from the original assets to either the proceeds of sale of the assets to either the proceeds of sale of the assets or new substituted assets.
